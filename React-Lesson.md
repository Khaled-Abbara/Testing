# Summary of Session One

## What is React?
React is a frontend library developed by facebook that uses a virtual DOM to keep track of what the user does  instead of updating the DOM.

## React's design philosophy (React Mentality) 

We divide the website into reusable components. 
Each compenent is writen as a function that displays jsx. 

the code is written like a root structure of plant or a christmas tree, where one component houses other componenets inside it. This apporach means that the failure of components lower below does not affect the entire website. and that when changes are made due to users actions; the whole site does not have to reload again (more info will be provided below).

## Why React?

1. It's main selling point is by adding logic to HTML in the form of JSX.
2. It introduces a virtual DOM which makes your code base less of a Fettuccine Alfredo in the long run.
3. It's faster and easier to use than 'Vanilla JS'.
4. Alot of companies use it, so there is a good job opportunity (Other frontend librarys are very similar).
5. I like it, and it was What I felt was missing with my Webshop.

 

This all simplifies the code and makes it easier to maintain and reuse.
